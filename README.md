It was the major project carried out during my bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering.
The project is about making a prosthetic hand capable of performing movements and accomplishing the tasks based on the inputs provided by EEG signals, Gestures and Voice as well.
To capture the EEG signals from human brain, Brainsense Headset was used where as flex sensors were employed to carry out gestures based functions.
