# Design-and-Implementation-of-Smart-Prosthetic-Hand
This was the major project carried out during my bachelors. The project is about making a prototype of a prosthetic hand that is capable of accomplishing the tasks based on user's EEG signals, Gestures and Voice as well. To capture and process EEG signals, Brainsense Headset was used and Flex sensors were employed to take care of gestures tasks
